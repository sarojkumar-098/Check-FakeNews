# Check-FakeNews
# Fake News Detection

This repository contains the code and resources for detecting fake news using machine learning techniques. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, `check FakeNews.ipynb`, which includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Overview

Fake news is a growing problem in today's digital age, spreading misinformation across social media and other platforms. This project aims to build a model that can classify news articles as either fake or real.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of labeled news articles. Each article is categorized as either fake or real. You can find more details about the dataset in the notebook.

Model
This project uses machine learning models such as:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forest

Feature extraction is performed using techniques like TF-IDF, and the models are trained on these features.

The trained model achieved the following performance metrics:

Accuracy: [98.98%]
